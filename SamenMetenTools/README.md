# MySense Samen Meten Tools
Last update of the README on 17th Februari 2025

## Description
Python toolset to allow air quaility data analistics on measurements generated by low-cost (DIY) stations.
This is **WORK IN PROGRESS!**, inspired by the Samen Meten Tools from a Samen Meten Zuinige Rijder (Rick).
Current (first) module is to provide a Python engine to obtain meta stations information in Python dict format and sensor observation data over a period of time in Python Pandas format for processing these website queries results by other tooling.

One is invited to check the implementation, improve functions, add archiving functions, improve performance or suggest usage functions.

The current state is the core interface to Samen Meten website API query interface (version 1.1), archiving measurement data in different formats like (gzipped) json (need standardisation efforts), (gzipped) CSV format, XSLX spreadsheet (gzipped) format and HTML interactive map webpage with detailed regional (DIY) measurement station information. 
To Do: One is invited to add functionality to add governmental station info to the SamenMetenThgings.py module.

The goal is to add a data analyse layer: data validation, data correction, data calibration, data analisation report generator, and data visualisation (interactive heatmaps?) based on the lower level (website query, archived information and archived measure) library modules.

The scripts will use various command line options, defined as XYZ=value:
- non optional argument names are either file names, regional names, station names, GPS location.
- **Verbosity**=n level, input/output **File**=name, **DEBUG**, compression method, delimeter char, test data only, etc.
- Filtering options:
  - **Sensors**='pm10,pm25,pm10_kal,pm25_kal,temp,rh,no2,o3,co2,nh3' or reg.exp to focus on these sensors only.
  - **Expand**='location,address,owner,project' to expand (a table join) db table domains.
  - **Select**='' (default all) to filter station names. Use regular expression.

Use CLI **python3 ScriptName.py help** option to get more information about the use of CLI options.

## Samen Meten Things tools architecture

![SamenMetenArchitecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01a0a6b5-c6db-432b-8c1c-b83a8c4d7264)

The Python3 (>= version 3.8) scripts/modules carry an extensive amount of documentation and comments. This may help you to answer the question 'how did they do it?' and use of API interface standards. Read thye source to get an impression of which Python (import) library modules are being used.

## Outline of modules
### needed Python library modules
Various not standard Python modules are used in the scripts:
- xlsxwriter
- pandas
- dateparser
- aiohttp
- tzlocal
- dateutil
- folium
- pygeohash

  Install them with e.g. apt -y install module_name.
  For easy search for neighbours geohashing is used. E.g. the module cgeohashing. One has to install it via pip3. Or use an own Python module.

## Example of CLI script use
For test purpuses as long as the architecture of the tools is notr ready yet, one can use the follwing CLI commands to get a map with measurement stations in a village.

First get an archive in CSV format for a period of time:
  python3 Things2CSV.py Expand='location,address,owner,project' Sensors='(pm25|pm10)' Period='2018-01-01,now' Verbosity=2 User='MySense' File='Leidschendam-Voorburg.csv' 'Leidschendam-Voorburg'
This will take about 5 minutes per region. More regions can be added on the command line end.

Second to generate the HTML map with Things stations:
  python3 Things2HTML.py Leidschendam-Voorburg.csv
This will generate the file Regions\ Leidschendam-Voorburg.html
  
### SamenMetenThings.py
The Samen Meten Things module provides a python interface to the RIVM Things API (an API) and various other website query services like Open Data Soft (CBS queries e.g. municipality id numbers) and Open Street Map (addresses of stations). The GPS location resolution is about 100 meters (3 decimals).
The main routines are able to collect meta information (status information of the station, installed sensors and sensor types, period of availability, location, address, citizen reference stations), neighbouring stations, stations in a municipality of near a GPS location) and observation data in a period of time, all in Pandas (dataframe series) format.
All the routines can be called as standalone (CLI) for test purposes.

The module is operating in multiprocessing modus. This gives a factor of 2-5 of speedup.
E.g. one website query can take 2-30 seconds (usualy 15 seconds). To obtain info about one sensor of a station it takes about 2 information requests, followed by 1 observation requests per sensor. The common station has about 4-6 sensors. A municipality has about 100 stations. This gives you about: 100 X (2 X 5 X 6) X 15 seconds if request are done sequently.

The current modules are in alpha status and subjected to improvements and need to be extented with more or better functionality. In other words: help!

The module consists about of 50% of documentation and have a 'help' function for CLI usage. The modules gives you a good overview of backgrounds of the website query interfaces and how to use Samen Meten tools and interfaces.
So read the module script!

Example output file: Real life regional stations overview (gzipped json format) is 'Land van Cuijk.json.gz'. Generation took about 1 hour to generate (111 low-cost stations with different sensors installed).
Most of the time was spend waitinmg on Things queries results. *Conclusion*: use local archived data as much as possible.

### Things2XLSX.py
Things2XLSX will generate XLSX spreadsheet with overview of Things station names, location (GPS, address),
station properties (owner, project, gemcode, reference station codes),
and operational data of installed sensors (type, first and last timestamps, record count).
The spreadsheets will show per sheet the historical and current stations information.
Station names will be in color to denote active states (red: station not active in the period, orange: lately not active, black: active).

Example of generated output file for region Land van Cuijk is 'Land van Cuijk.xlsx'.

The script uses municipality stations routine of the SamenMetenThings class module.

### Things2HTML.py
Things2HTML will generate an interactive (Python Folium is used) Open Streep Map with regional low-cost station location markers.
Clicking a marker will show information of installed sensors and operational timings. The chart is interactive.
The goal is to present heatmaps of measurements as well of PM calibrated (temperature and RH) measurements.
The generated HTML can be include on your website via e.g. <iframe src=HTMLfile>.

The file 'Land van Cuijk.html' is a real life example of a generated HTML interactive map page for an overview of Samen Meten stations in the region Land van Cuijk in Holland. Which can be visualised via a browser.

### Things2CSV.py
Things2CSV will generate a CSV file from station information obtained from JSON (one dimensional or multi dymensional) dict or downloaded regional stations information via Samen Meten API (SamenMetenTools.py) as comma separated file (default delimeter ';'). Content structure is:
1. comment lines, start with '#' char, with file properties as e.g. owner, version, project, title, subject, etc.
2. column header line with column names in either human readable format, or Things standard naming.
3. station info lines, default ';' char separated.

Generated file maybe gzipped compressed. Example of generated CSV file is 'test-stations.csv' (generated from 'test-stations.json.gz).

### ThingsArchive.py
This module will await completion of alpha tests of other modules.

This script a a wrapper for XLSX, HTML map, CSV (+compressed), and JSON (+compressed).
Input can be regional names (Samen Meten Things website will be used to download data), various file formats.
The central archive will use Python Pandas dataframe format.
